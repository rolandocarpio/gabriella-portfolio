            <h1 class="d-flex" style="font-weight: bold;">About Me</h1>
            <p class="lead">Over the past four years, I've worked on a variety of film productions, including
                feature-length films, music
                videos, short films, commercials, student films, as well as AFI, USC, and Columbia graduate thesis
                films.
                I've transitioned from being a Production Assistant to taking on various roles, such as Second Assistant
                Camera, Gaffer, Key Grip, Best Electric, Production Designer, Prop Master, and more.
            <p class="lead">All the while, I've dedicated myself to learning the technical skills and processes of production,
                simultaneously nurturing and expanding my profound interest in the theory and history of film and media.
                While at Columbia, I became the University News Photo Deputy at Columbia Daily Spectator, started
                freelance
                photography, attended numerous film screenings, and extensively networked with alumni, peers, and
                accomplished professionals in the industry.
            <p class="lead">
                My humanist media approach to photography and film constantly pushes me to continue evolving my
                storytelling
                capabilities and expanding my repertoire of technical skills.
                When I'm not behind the lens, you'll likely find me rewatching Spirited Away, embarking on a hike,
                immersed
                in video games, or baking cookies.
